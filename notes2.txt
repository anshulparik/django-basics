- Previously we generated django project.
- Here we will generate django app.
- App should be modular, we might have different parts of larger prjects broken into apps.
- These modular apps can be taken out from one django project and can be used in another
  django project.


=> To create an app:
py manage.py startapp posts

=> To link our app with our project:
- In settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS add posts.

=> Templates for app:
- For this we will create new templates folder in our app(posts) directory.

=> For urls:
- We will create new urls.py file in our app(posts) directory.
- Then we will register this app urls.py in our main(projects) urls.py.



=> Steps to create new template which can be used in all the pages:
- For this we will create layout.html
- Then load the static assets:
  {% load static %}

- In head:  
    <link rel="stylesheet" href={% static 'css/style.css' %} />
    <script src={% static 'js/main.js' %} defer></script>

- For dynamic insertion: 
  {% block title %}
    Django App
  {% endblock %}

NOTE: Here if title is not passed dynamically then Django App will be default title.

- Now in homme.html we will layout.html
    {% extends "layout.html" %}

    {% block title %}
    Home
    {% endblock %}


    {% block content %}
    <h1>Welcome to Home Page</h1>
    <p>Checkout my about page <a href="/about">About</a></p>
    {% endblock  %}

NOTE: Here we are extending layout file and passing the title and content dynamically.
