- Previously we generated django project.
- Here we will generate django app.
- App should be modular, we might have different parts of larger prjects broken into apps.
- These modular apps can be taken out from one django project and can be used in another
  django project.


=> To create an app:
py manage.py startapp posts

=> To link our app with our project:
- In settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS add posts.

=> Templates for app:
- For this we will create new templates folder in our app(posts) directory.

=> For urls:
- We will create new urls.py file in our app(posts) directory.
- Then we will register this app urls.py in our main(projects) urls.py.
