=> Models
- We create models in models.py file in our app(posts).
- These models are in the form of classes.
- Then these models gets migrated and becomes tables in database.

NOTE: The warning which we receive in terminal when we run our app is because django has some
built in models and we need to migrate them. To migrate them:
- py manage.py migrate 

=> To migrate our custom created model(Post):
- py manage.py makemigrations
- py manage.py migrate             // to apply migrations



=> Django ORM

=> To move into the shell:
- py manage.py shell

=> To import models
from posts.models import Post

=> To create instance of a model:
p = Post()

=> To save post in Post model:
p.title = "My first Post!"

=> To save it to database"
p.save()

=> To retreive all the posts from the database:
Post.objects.all()

=> To exit the shell:
exit()

NOTE: We can create function(method) inside our model class.
