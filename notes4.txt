=> Django Admin
- Admin URL is already there in main urls.py by default.
- From this admin url, we can log into django administration.
- To login into django administration we need creds of superuser.

=> To create superuser creds:
- py manage.py createsuperuser
  - username: anshul
  - password: test@123


- In users if staff status is true, that user can access django administration panel.
- We can use django administration panel as a CMS as well.
- For that we need to import our model in our apps admin.py file.
- This will show our model into django administration panel, from there we can manage our data.


NOTE: We can pass data from view to template.

=> To pass data from views(route) to template:
def posts_list(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'posts/posts_list.html', { 'posts': posts })


=> To access data from views(route) in template:
    {% for post in posts %}
    {% endfor %}
