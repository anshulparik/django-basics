=> File upload

- In main settings.py file we need to define media url and folder path:
MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path(BASE_DIR, 'media')

- In main urls.py file add:
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

=> To work with images, we need one additional library:
- pip install Pillow

=> To save images in DB, we need to add an extra field to our model:
banner = models.ImageField(default='fallback.png', blank=True)

=> Then we will migrate our model:
- py manage.py makemigrations
- py manage.py migrate
